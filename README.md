# Notes App

### Description

This project was developed as a Node.js exercise while studying [The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/) hosted by Andrew Mead.

Basically, this is a Node module containing a note taking app which uses the command line to operate. It can create, open (read), list and remove (delete) notes from JSON file which is created once notes are added.
